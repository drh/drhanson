This directory contains the 'old' version of loom. This version of loom is 
intended for C programs and contains some C dependencies.

The makefile details how to build loom. A manual page is in loom.1.

common.c is the common words program from which the program described
in the 'Literate Programming' column in the Communications of the ACM,
vol. 30, no. 7, 594-599, July 1987 was derived. common.c also contains
the documentation, which is an expanded version of the CACM paper. This
documentation appeared in D. R. Hanson, 'Printing Common Words', Tech.
Report 86-18, Dept. of Computer Science, Univ. of Arizona, May 1986.

Several readers found an error in the common words program presented in
the CACM paper and others suggested improvements. This version of
common.c incorporates changes made in response to their comments.

The makefile also contains entries for making common, the executable
version of the common words program, and common.dvi, its TeX
documentation. Both are constructed from common.c.

common.c is an example of loom usage. Since it uses several unavailable filters 
and programs (e.g., prog, xref, and makeindex), it is not possible to construct 
common.tex from common.c as shown in the makefile.

In addition, common.tex depends on the TeX macro packages loommac.tex and 
macros.tex, which are not included here, but are available at 
http://drhanson.googlecode.com/svn/tex/trunk. loommac.tex and macros.tex are 
used to typeset loom documents in a style similar to Don Knuth's WEB system. 
Other styles can be generated by using other macros.
