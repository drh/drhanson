EZ is a language-based programming environment that offers the services
provided separately by programming languages and operating systems in
traditional environments.  These services are provided as facilities of
a high-level string processing language with a `persistent' memory in
which values exist indefinitely or until changed.  In EZ, strings and
associative tables provide traditional file and directory services.
This talk describes the use of EZ procedures and their activations,
which, like other values, have indefinite lifetimes.  In EZ, the
low-level aspects of procedure execution, such as activation record
creation, references to local variables, and access to state
information, are accessible via high-level language constructs.  As a
result, traditionally distinct services can be provided by a single
service in the EZ environment, and such services are written in EZ.  An
editor/debugger that illustrates the details of this approach is
described.
