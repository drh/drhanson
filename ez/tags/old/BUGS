(lines beginning with `-' indicate the bug is fixed.)

-1.  Two for in loops in editor.S don't work.

2.  t[2][3] = 4 gives an error, and doesn't set t[2] or t[3].  It works
    if t[2] already exists.

-3.  the program "if (x) y = 3" assigns 3 to y even is x is void.

-4.  the program "while (1) write(1)" gets evaluation stack overflow.

-5.  the program "for(;;)write(1)" loops.

-6.  the expression 6 < 5 < 7 returns 7!

-7.  the program "for(;;)write(1)" gives evaluation stack overflow (after
    bug #5 was fixed).

8.  need "not" operator to avoid "if(expr)0 else break" kludge

9.  bug9.S gets a bus error

10. type(1<0) is not "void", the manual notwithstanding

11. bug11.S responds to input line "cd" with "12error 107...".
    yet the stmt is correct, and worse, it should not be executed.

12.  Fixing bugs 4, 5, and 7 introduced another bug -- values
     of expressions outside procedures are not printed.   Problem
     is indiscriminate use of o_base.
