This directory contains versions of malloc, calloc, realloc, and free
that detect usage errors. This package was part of an assignment in the
Fall 1994 offering of Princeton's COS 217, Introduction to Systems
Programming.

The important files are

index.html
Explains the semantics of the allocation functions and their interaction with 
memmon, the program that actually detects the errors and prints the diagnostics.

memmon.1
a man page for memmon; it explains the format of the messages sent from
the allocation functions to memmon.

This version of the library and of memmon run on the SPARC (Unix) and Intel 
(Linux, OS X 10.4.9).

Installation involves 2 files: build memmon first with the commands

	make memmon
	mv memmon /usr/local/lib/memmon
	cp memmon.1 /usr/local/man/man1

where "/usr/local/lib/memmon" is the local path for memmon. Then build
and install libmalloc.a:

	make CFLAGS='-g -DMEMMON="/usr/local/lib/memmon"' libmalloc.a
	mv libmalloc.a /usr/local/lib
	ranlib /usr/local/lib/libmalloc.a

where the value assigned to MEMMON is the same path you used above to
install memmon.
